# The Flame & the Reflection – Fear Trials Overview

The “trials” are not tests to pass or fail.
They are structured encounters with fear, seen through four lenses:

1. **Mind Trial – The Maze of Thoughts**
2. **Body Trial – The Bridge of Sensations**
3. **Spirit Trial – The Field of Meaning**
4. **Shadow Trial – The Reflection in the Flame**

### Design Principles

- Always opt-out-able.
- Always reversible.
- Always framed as curiosity, never as judgment.

### Example: Mind Trial Snapshot

- A shifting maze that responds to the child naming thoughts:
  - “I’m scared I’ll mess up.”
  - “I don’t know what will happen.”
- Each named thought appears as a small floating glyph.
- When acknowledged, paths open. When ignored, they gently linger, not attack.

### Culmination: The Reflection in the Flame

- A quiet, warm chamber.
- The child sees a symbolic “flame” that shows:
  - past fears they’ve named,
  - ways they chose to respond.
- The reflection speaks in their recorded choices:
  > “You walked through this once. You can walk again.”

The trial ends not with triumph music, but a soft exhale:
an environment shift, a new path, a sense of “I can meet this.”
