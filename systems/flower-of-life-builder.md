# Flower of Life Builder

The Flower of Life in The Garden is not a fixed sacred symbol.
It is a **living, evolving diagram** of a child’s inner world.

## Purpose

- Give the child a sense of continuity: “I am growing, even when I forget.”
- Visualize patterns of curiosity, fear, and joy over time.
- Provide caregivers with a *non-invasive* map of growth.

## Core Ideas

- Each **petal** or **circle** = a recurring theme:
  - “Things I’m curious about.”
  - “Things that scare me.”
  - “Things that make me feel safe.”
  - “People or places that matter to me.”

- Each **session** adds:
  - Color: emotional tone.
  - Size: intensity or frequency.
  - Sub-symbols: specific memories, builds, or breakthroughs.

## Mechanics (high-level)

1. **Tagging Events**

   Whenever a child:
   - answers a daily resonance prompt,
   - completes a micro-trial,
   - saves a blueprint,

   The system tags that moment with:
   - `emotion_state`
   - `theme`
   - `zone`
   - `timestamp`

2. **Mapping to the Flower**

   A simple mapping function converts events into Flower updates:

   - new petal if theme is fresh,
   - deepen color if theme repeats with similar emotion,
   - soften color if fear shifts toward understanding,
   - add subtle glow or pattern for “integration” moments.

3. **Child-Facing View**

   The child sees:
   - a beautiful, slowly complexifying pattern,
   - simple language like “Your ideas are growing branches here”,
   - the option to zoom into a petal and revisit memories or builds tied to it.

4. **Caregiver View**

   The caregiver sees:
   - aggregate patterns over weeks/months,
   - non-judgmental descriptors like:
     - “Exploring new fears gently.”
     - “Returning often to safety themes.”
     - “Curiosity about change and endings increasing.”

Nothing in the Flower should label the child.
It is a mirror, not a diagnosis.
