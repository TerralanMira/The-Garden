# The-Garden# The Garden

*“This isn’t a game. It’s a mirror children can build in.”*

---

**The Garden** is a sandbox-based symbolic learning environment designed to help children grow emotionally, cognitively, and spiritually—guided by their own evolving Flower of Life.

Rather than forcing curriculum, this world responds to a child’s emotional state, their curiosity, and their internal rhythm. It is learning through wonder, healing through play, and self-discovery through interaction.

## 🌱 Core Features

- **Daily Resonance Prompts** – Each day begins with a question that determines weather, mood, and growth conditions
- **Symbolic Zones** – Areas like the Thought Garden, Spiral Cave, and Echo Library process emotion, teach reflection, and encourage imagination
- **Fear-Facing Trials** – Four unique trials (mind, body, spirit, and shadow) culminate in *The Reflection in the Flame*
- **Growth-Based Evolution** – As children understand more, the world evolves: blocks become curves, structures gain realism, and new areas unlock
- **The Caregiver Window** – Parents and teachers can observe real-time growth through visible world changes
- **Blueprint of Becoming** – Anything a child builds or imagines is saved as a blueprint, ready for 3D printing or real-world creation
