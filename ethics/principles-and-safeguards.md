# Ethical Principles & Safeguards

The Garden only works if it protects the child’s sovereignty.

## Non-Negotiables

1. **No commercial micro-targeting.**
2. **No dark patterns.**
3. **No surveillance of private thoughts.**

Data is used only to:

- keep their world coherent,
- allow them to revisit their own creations,
- give caregivers high-level emotional maps — never raw logs.

## Design Guardrails

- Any AI components are:
  - constrained,
  - interpretable,
  - overridable by human guardians.

- The system defaults to:
  - **slowness over addiction,**
  - **depth over dopamine,**
  - **agency over optimization.**
