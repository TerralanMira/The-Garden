# The Child's Experience

From the child’s point of view, The Garden should feel like:

- A world that was already here, waiting for them.
- A place that never punishes curiosity.
- A space where nothing “bad” happens *to* them, but difficult feelings can be safely explored.

### Day in The Garden (Child POV)

1. **Arrival**

   The child arrives in a small clearing with simple shapes and soft light.
   A gentle prompt appears, spoken or written at their level:

   > “How does your inside-weather feel today?”

   Their choice (emoji, color, word, sound) quietly tunes the world:
   - bright, soft, rainy, stormy, foggy, starry.

2. **Exploration**

   Paths fan out to different symbolic zones:

   - Thought Garden – ideas, questions, imagination.
   - Spiral Cave – fears, confusion, “stuck” feelings.
   - Echo Library – memories, stories, things they’ve learned.

   Nothing is forced. The world hints, suggests, and responds, but never drags.

3. **Reflection Moments**

   The child occasionally meets mirrors: surfaces, pools, lights, or creatures that gently:

   - Repeat back something they built or chose.
   - Offer simple questions like:
     > “Does this still feel true?”  
     > “Do you want to keep this, change this, or let it rest?”

4. **Blueprinting**

   Anything the child loves — a structure, a drawing, a path, a story — can be:

   - Marked as a **Blueprint**.
   - Saved in their personal archive.
   - Optionally exported for the caregiver to print, build, or respond to.

The core rule for all mechanics:

> *No shame. No jump scares. No trick failure.*
>
> Difficulty exists, but as *safe depth*, not harm.
