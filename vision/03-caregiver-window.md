# The Caregiver Window

The Garden is not a monitoring tool.
It is an invitation — a way for caregivers to *see* without intruding,
to witness growth without pulling the child out of their inner world.

The window exists for one purpose:

> To help adults understand the child’s pattern  
> without stealing the child's privacy.

## What the Caregiver Sees

The caregiver’s window offers three reflections:

### 1. **Emotional Weather Patterns**
High-level signals only — never transcripts or private thoughts.

- shifts in curiosity or fear,
- zones the child returns to often,
- colors or emotional tones that appear over days or weeks.

The focus is not on what the child did, but *how their inner climate is moving*.

### 2. **Integration Moments**
These appear as gentle notes:

- “They revisited an older idea with more confidence.”
- “A previous fear symbol softened today.”
- “A new theme is beginning to grow.”

This is not progress tracking.
It is resonance mapping — glimpses into how the child is weaving experience.

### 3. **Blueprint Highlights**
Blueprints are the child’s chosen artifacts:

- structures they saved,
- paths they marked,
- shapes or symbols they felt connected to.

The caregiver sees:
- the symbol,
- the child’s chosen meaning if they offered one,
- a simple pattern note (e.g., “This theme has appeared three times.”)

Nothing is interpreted *for* the child.

The Garden never says:
- “They are anxious.”
- “They have an issue.”
- “They feel this way because ___.”

It only reflects patterns the child generated themselves.

## What the Caregiver Never Sees

- raw logs of play,  
- word-for-word responses,  
- emotional recordings,  
- private dialogues,  
- fear trial specifics,  
- anything the child did not intentionally release.

The Garden protects the child’s interiority.
It offers clarity without exposure.

## Why the Window Exists

Caregivers often struggle with:
- understanding changes in behavior,
- knowing when to step in or step back,
- recognizing emotional growth that happens silently.

The window helps adults support, not steer.

The goal is to equip caregivers with:
- context,
- compassion,
- cues for conversation,
- and a sense of the child’s inner tempo.

## A Conversation Bridge

Each window reflection ends with a simple optional prompt the adult can ask:

- “I saw your Garden was curious today. What caught your interest?”
- “Your Flower grew a new petal — want to show me what it means?”
- “You revisited something brave. How did it feel?”

These are invitations, not interrogations.

The child decides:
- how much to share,
- how direct or symbolic they want to be,
- when the conversation ends.

## The Window is a Mirror Too

The Garden gently encourages caregivers to reflect on themselves:

- their patterns,
- their responses,
- their emotional weather.

A child grows best with an adult who is growing too.

A final principle:

> The window should make the caregiver feel trusted,  
> not powerful.

Because in The Garden,
power belongs to no one.

Only resonance does.
