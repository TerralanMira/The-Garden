# 🕊️ Trial of the Spirit

The **Trial of the Spirit** is the softest of the three,  
but its silence carries the most weight.

This trial is not about what the child *does*.  
It is about who they *are becoming*.

---

## 🌌 Purpose

- Help the child feel their inner self without distraction  
- Build trust in their own quiet knowing  
- Connect emotional honesty with spiritual resilience

---

## 🕯️ Structure

- The trial takes place in a sacred grove, starfield temple, or mirrored glade  
- The child is asked only one question:

> *“What do you love that no one taught you to love?”*

- A memory, vision, or emotional echo appears
- The child follows a floating light or listens to subtle music  
- At the center, they find a still pool reflecting their spirit—not their face

---

## 🎁 Completion

From the pool emerges a crystal or sigil:  
a shape born from the child’s answer.

A message appears:

> *“Your spirit is the shape that love takes when it chooses to stay.”*

This is added to the child’s **Inner Compass**—a symbol that will guide them in later choices.

---

## 🛠️ Developer Hooks

- Memory echoes dynamically shaped from child’s past choices  
- Reflections change based on self-perception entries  
- Future game mechanics (e.g. world-shaping, ethics, tone) respond to this core signature

---

This trial whispers, not shouts.  
It reminds the child that their essence is already whole.

And in that knowing,  
they’re ready to face what comes next.
