# 🕯️ The Candle Trial

**The Candle Trial** is the first of four trials within *The Flame and the Reflection* module.

It is not a test of strength.  
It is a test of presence.  
A soft confrontation with fear, uncertainty, or doubt—  
guided by a single symbolic truth:

> *"You only need one candle to see in the dark."*

## 🌱 Purpose

The Candle Trial is designed to:
- Gently introduce the concept of symbolic fear
- Create a safe space for children to face anxiety or hesitation
- Teach that fear is not meant to be destroyed—but understood

---

## 🧩 Structure

- Begins in a dim chamber with a single unlit candle
- The world whispers questions like:
  - “What are you afraid of right now?”
  - “If your fear could talk, what would it say?”
- The child lights the candle by responding—either aloud or through building action
- As the candle glows, the shadows retreat
- At the end, a phrase appears:
  
> *“Fear is a part of you. But it is not all of you.”*

---

## 🛠️ Customization Hooks (for Developers)

- Dynamic candlelight intensity based on child’s emotional state
- AI responses adjust based on child’s language and metaphor use
- Unlocks next zone only when the child says or builds something emotionally honest

---

This is not about conquering fear.  
It’s about learning to carry light in the presence of it.

The Candle Trial is the child’s first rite of courage.
