# 🧠 Trial of the Mind

The **Trial of the Mind** strengthens the child's ability to think clearly, ask questions, and reflect without judgment.

It is not about getting the right answer.  
It is about learning to **trust curiosity**.

---

## 🌀 Purpose

- Build confidence in the child’s ability to observe and think  
- Teach emotional logic: that feelings are data, not distractions  
- Begin the integration of critical thinking with self-awareness

---

## 🔍 Structure

- Begins with a symbolic puzzle (e.g. broken mirror, echoing hall, incomplete path)
- Questions whisper through the space:
  - “What are you trying to see?”
  - “Where is your mind going when you feel unsure?”
- Child progresses by:
  - Solving a symbolic riddle  
  - Assembling a memory from fragments  
  - Rebuilding a fractured space (block structure or light bridge)

---

## ✨ Reward

At the trial’s end, a book appears titled:

> *“Your thoughts are not enemies. They are echoes asking for clarity.”*

This becomes the first entry in the child’s **Mental Archive**.

---

## 🛠️ Developer Hooks

- Puzzle difficulty adapts to user’s interaction history
- Reflections saved and shown later in *The Echo Library*
- Optional AI hint system styled as a question, not a command

---

The Trial of the Mind teaches the child to think with precision—  
not to control the world,  
but to understand their place within it.
